### :warning: IMPORTANT UPDATE :warning:

This project (and the corresponding [player library](https://github.com/samiare/whitewater-mobile-video)) are **no longer maintained**.

This was an enormously fun project to create, but I never had adequate time for updates and it was made almost immediately obsolete by the adoption of auto-play HTML5 video in most mobile web browsers soon after it's initial release.
